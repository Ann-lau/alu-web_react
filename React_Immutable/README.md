- All files should end with a new line
- All functions must be exported

## Setup
If needed, install the required Node.js and npm versions:

```bash
# On Ubuntu (optional if Node and npm already installed)
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs
